## Franka panda robot gazebo simulation
Gazebo simulation for nonlinear model predictive control based motion planner for collision avoidance.
## Simulation Configuration
1. Franka panda 7dof manipulator
2. Target (green sphere)
3. Obstacle (red sphere)

To improve the calculation speed of collision detection, collision is simplified to a cylinder in urdf
